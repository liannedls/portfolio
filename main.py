# Introduction Section
st.header("About Me")
st.markdown("""
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of Psychiatry at McGill University, where I work with Drs. Kyle Greenway, Soham Rej, Alex Lehmann, and Michael Lifshitz. 
I completed my Ph.D. in Experimental Psychology at the University of Ottawa, where I examined clinical and electrophysiological correlates of the antidepressant treatment response to ketamine infusions in treatment-resistant depression.
My current research focuses on altered states of consciousness, psilocybin-assisted psychotherapy, the experiential factors of ‚Äòset‚Äô (mindset) and ‚Äòsetting‚Äô (physical and social environments), and the importance of culture and individually-tailoring mental health treatments.
Currently, I am supported by a Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) Postdoctoral Fellowship award.
